# Inferential-Statistical-Analysis-of-Student-Demographics-Quality-Control-and-Salary-Determinants
Analyzed CMSU student data, shingle moisture levels, and salary by education and occupation using inferential statistics. Applied probability, t-tests, and ANOVA to uncover insights on demographics, product quality, and salary trends. Key findings support data-driven decisions.

Problem 1
Context
The Student News Service at Clear Mountain State University (CMSU) has decided to gather data about the undergraduate students that attend CMSU. CMSU creates and distributes a survey of 14 questions and receives responses from 62 undergraduates (stored in the Survey data set).

Objective
Based on the given data, answer the following questions.

What is the probability that a randomly selected CMSU student will be male?
What is the probability that a randomly selected CMSU student will be female?
What is the conditional probability of different majors among male students in CMSU?
What is the conditional probability of different majors among the female students of CMSU?
What is the probability That a randomly chosen student is a male and intends to graduate?
What is the probability that a randomly selected student is a female and does NOT have a laptop?
What is the probability that a randomly chosen student is a male or has full-time employment?
What is the conditional probability that given a female student is randomly chosen, she is majoring in international business or management?
If a student is chosen randomly, what is the probability that his/her GPA is less than 3?
What is the conditional probability that a randomly selected male earns 50 or more?
What is the conditional probability that a randomly selected female earns 50 or more?
Are the continuous variables in the data normally distributed? Write a note summarizing your conclusions.
Note: Assume that the sample is representative of the population of CMSU.

Data Description

ID: A unique identifier for each undergraduate student.

Gender: The gender of the student.

Age: The age of the student. It is a numeric value representing the student's age in years.

Class: The student's current academic class or year.

Major: The student's declared major field of study.

Grad Intention: The student's intention regarding graduation. It can have categorical values such as "Yes" or "No" indicating whether the student intends to graduate or not.

GPA: The student's grade point average. It is a numeric value representing the student's academic performance.

Employment: The employment status of the student. It can have categorical values such as "Full-time," "Part-time," or "Unemployed."

Salary: The student's monthly salary. It is a numeric value representing the amount in dollars.

Social Networking: The amount of time the student spends on social networking per day. It is a numeric value representing the time in hours.

Satisfaction: The student's satisfaction level with their college experience. It is a numeric value representing satisfaction on a scale.

Spending: The amount of money the student spends per semester. It is a numeric value representing the amount in dollars.

Computer: The type of device of the student.

Text Messages: The number of text messages the student sends per day. It is a numeric value.
 

Problem 2
Context
An important quality characteristic used by the manufacturers of ABC asphalt shingles is the amount of moisture the shingles contain when they are packaged. Customers may feel that they have purchased a product lacking in quality if they find moisture and wet shingles inside the packaging. In some cases, excessive moisture can cause the granules attached to the shingles for texture and coloring purposes to fall off the shingles resulting in appearance problems. To monitor the amount of moisture present, the company conducts moisture tests. A shingle is weighed and then dried. The shingle is then reweighed, and based on the amount of moisture taken out of the product, the pounds of moisture per 100 square feet is calculated. The company would like to show that the mean moisture content is less than 0.35 pounds per 100 square feet.

Objective
Based on the above context, the manufacturer wants to understand the following:

Is there any evidence that the mean moisture content in both types of shingles is within the permissible limits?
Is the population mean for shingles A and B are equal?
Use the relevant statistical tests to answer the above questions and state your conclusions along with all necessary steps.

Hint: Use the test for equality of means for the second question

 

Problem 3
Context
Salary is hypothesized to depend on educational qualification and occupation. To understand the dependency, the salaries of 40 individuals are collected and each person’s educational qualification and occupation are noted. Educational qualification is at three levels, High school graduate, Bachelor's, and Doctorate. Occupation is at four levels, Administrative and clerical, Sales, Professional or specialty, and Executive or managerial. A different number of observations are in each level of education–occupation combination.

Objective
Based on the above context, we want to understand the following:

Is there any significant difference in salaries among different levels of education?
Is there any significant difference in salaries among different levels of different occupations?
Is there a significant interaction between Education and Occupation on Salary?
Use the relevant statistical tests to answer the above questions and state your conclusions along with all necessary steps.

Note: Assume that the data follows a normal distribution. In reality, the normality assumption may not always hold if the sample size is small.
